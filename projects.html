                    REVLR is a tool to build Mind-map like structures in 3D VR.
                    It's being developed primarily by the Imaging Research Center, where I work.
                    I contributed to this over my 2025 summer internship.
                    Specifically, I made the base of the navigation systems, the login menu, and the autosave system.

                    Danger Ice Skater is my GMTK Game Jam 2025 submission.
                    Some friends and I got together to make this awesome project over the course of four days.
                    What makes this one really special is that pretty much every asset in this project is something made in house, even down to the font.
                    I made the game overhead, enemy AI (sorry) and did general PR work and polishing across the whole project.
                    We did an awesome job here, please check it out!

                    Wishmaker is a small project that I was working on in early 2025 as project lead and programmer.
                    Some friends and I came together to try to make a roguelike with a Hades-style run layout and Terraria-like gameplay.
                    While it's on hold for now, I worked really hard on the codebase, and it's the first time I tried a lot of new patterns of programming games based on what I learned.
                    Unfortunately, the repository isn't public, but I can still say I was the main contributor!
                    I'd say that it's the first project that I properly thought out and planned, and I still really want to finish or see it to fruition!
                    Some day though, I'm too busy these days.

                    From 2020 to 2024, I was a contributor to Hypixel Skyblock's volunteer design team.
                    Our team was a resource that the designers and developers could bounce ideas off to see if the community would agree to them.
                    I workshopped ideas with a lot of my fellow nerds to come up with concepts for future updates, many of which got shipped!
                    It's also where I learned how to code and design games.
